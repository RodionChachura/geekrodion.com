Building good habits or activities and then keeping them isn't an easy
task. Especially in times when you want to start building a few habits
at once or come back to good old ones. The most common advice in such
situations is to start doing one activity at the time and, when you
stick with it, go to another. However, I want to show you an approach
that can help you more.

## Maslow's Hierarchy ofÂ Needs

I think you heard about Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In simple words, it
shows that man starts going after upper-level needs after he satisfied
the ones below. For example, he will not feel an urgent desire to meet
his esteem needs until he feels safe. Or he will start searching for
self-actualization only when he has love and belonging. Of course, an
order of these needs may vary from person to person, yet I want to
remind you about this concept before going farther since Pyramid is
quite similar.

## Building the Pyramid of Habits

The same concept as in Maslow's hierarchy can be applied to your habits
too. First, list bad habits that you want to remove from your life and
good ones you want to keep or add in your life. Go through each of them
and give them value from zero to ten based on their importance. Finally,
organize the list the way that the most important habits are in the base
of the Pyramid and the less important at the top.

## Track the Progress

With the Pyramid in place, you can see what is most important, and you
are ready to start building and maintaining habits and activities at the
base. When you feel momentum with those habits, you can go to the next
level. It is more reliable to keep the Pyramid and your progress
somewhere so that you can be self-accountable and see patterns that harm
your habits system. I would recommend updating the progress every
morning on paper, Google Sheet, or any other place.

## Keep Order up to Date

Our lives are in constant change. Activities that were important for us
can lose value with time. Give yourself time to go through the pyramid
from time to time and think about how each habit relates to your life
right now. You can build a practice to reshape it when something changes
in your life or do this every week or month.
