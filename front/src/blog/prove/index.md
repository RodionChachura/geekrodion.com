Did you ever present a future situation where you are successful and
show others that you are the one who is able to achieve something in
life? Maybe you imagined this situation and feeling of seeing envy in
somebody's eyes. Seeing that they are feeling miserable compare to
yourself? I did.

When we are starting improving ourselves with motivation to prove to
others that we are capable of something is better than not initiating
any movement forward in our lives. Yet after some time, we should come
closer to the moment when we stop caring about external validation from
others. When we are doing things because this is who we are, and there
is no way of not doing it. When we can't stop pursuing our goals, not
because of what other people may say if we quit, but because we can't
bear the feeling of not standing up to our standards.

Most probably, these thoughts come to us very rarely, like once in a few
months or so, and we think that this is not a big deal. But these
imaginations are what holds us back. When we don't have any thoughts of
external validation from others - we are free to do whatever is right
for us. If what we are doing won't work out, we won't feel ourselves as
a failure because we were doing what our true self calling was telling
us to do. There was no way for not doing it - we fail, learn, and go
back to work.

We need to be self-aware to see if we do particular things to get
external validation. When we talk to somebody, we don't need to say
about our successes, unless we are sure that it will inspire that
person. And sadly, there are not so many people searching for
inspiration. The same applies to social media. If we are not influencers
who make money by producing content online, why are we need to show off?
The people we are going to impress by posting things online most
probably aren't the people we should care about impressing anyway.

To reach our goals is to become the person capable of reaching them,
become the best version of ourselves. And sure, this person doesn't give
a single fuck about what some people from the past will think about him,
he hasn't walked such a long path to prove anything to somebody, but
himself.

Next time you find yourself imagining these situations think about your
better future self and if he would search for validation from others or
not. As more you become aware of it, as more freely you'll be able to
work on your goals, without neediness to prove anything.
