When I just started programming, I liked to read blogs and watch videos showing the process of apps creation. I found this very helpful. Now I want to write a series that will walk you through the creation of a simplified version of Medium. I hope you will find this series useful!

## Technologies

For the back-end part, we will use ASP.NET Core 2. And for the front-end part — React and Redux. I will use VS Code as a code editor and Ubuntu 18.04 as O.S. If you are using other code editor or operation systems — it is not a problem. Since both nodeJS and .NET Core are cross-platform technologies.
