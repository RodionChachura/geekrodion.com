As software developers, we often face a task of providing infrastructure for a web app we are building. There are tons of services to host the web app and provide CI/CD for it. A lot of them only creates abstraction levels above infrastructure as service providers such as AWS. And in reality, it is much easier to learn how to deal with Terraform and AWS, so that you can use those tools not only for hosting and providing CI/CD but for any DevOps-related task, you may encounter.

In this course, we will buy a domain via Route53. Then we create a certificate via the Certificate Manager. After that, we will use CloudFront to deliver web app to the users. Then we will make CI/CD pipeline via CodePipeline so that every time we make a commit in particular branch web app will be updated. And finally, we will provide all this infrastructure for the stage version of the app. To create all this resource we will use Terraform, it means, we will not click buttons and fill forms to create resources but write actual code.

At this course, you will learn how to create and manage AWS resource via Terraform. And next time you will need to provide infrastructure for a web app it will take you just a few minutes.
