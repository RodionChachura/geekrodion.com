We won't live forever, and we don't know when we die. It could be
tomorrow or 80 years into the future. No matter how hard we are trying
to live the healthiest lifestyle, we can't know for sure that we won't
die in the next few months. Yes, it is not common to talk about this,
but I want you to understand before reading any further - your lifespan
is unknown. You won't live forever, and you are not forever young. The
time is ticking, and it against you. The only you can do is take the
maximum from the time you have.

## Do You Have Ambition?

A lot of people think that someday, somehow, they would become wealthy,
healthy, fit, put all their shit together and obtain a piece of mind.
But they don't take massive action to achieve all of these good things.
They don't understand that time is finite and every second count. And
this is fine since not everybody has a wild desire to reach their big
goals. Please, listen to yourself, and if you don't feel hunger for
reaching your potential - stop reading.

## Stay Focused

If you are hungry, you should be ready to pay the price for future
success. No matter what your goal is, you need to invest a lot of hours
into deep, focused work. If you work on your project and check Instagram
every 15 minutes or allow anybody to distract you for no reason or you
thinking about life problems on the background, you simply wasting your
time and energy. By being aware of how are you working, you can make
more done in less time and won't be tired at the end of the day.

## Keep Grinding

You know that to become great at what you do, you need to grind through
things that you don't like doing or that make you uncomfortable. For
example, if you want to become one of the best guitar players, you will
make a plan and work on all parts - technique, music theory,
improvisation, and so on. Yet if you want to become a great bodybuilder
and will go to the gym every day only to train chest and biceps,
ignoring other muscles, you won't become the next Arnold. You know what
you need to work on, so start taking action.

## Trust the Process

Be honest with yourself and estimate how many years would it take to
reach your goals without changing the current way of living and attitude
to time. If you work hard and keep in mind that time is finite, it may
take a few years. But if you do little or nothing - the number is
infinity. To increase your probability of succeeding, you need to make a
plan for a day, week, month, or year. Then you put all doubts aside and
commit to the plan. After that, you take time to reflect, think, and
learn. Then you repeat again and again. You may fail on first
iterations, but don't give up. It takes time and effort to get knowledge
and discipline yourself.
