A few years ago, I was going through a stressful period. I was working a
full-time job, studying at university, and building a side-project. I
had a hard time falling asleep and waking up. I was a mess.

One time I decided to take a walk. I went to the stadium and began to
pass a circle after a circle. While walking, I had time to think about
the day and the things I do. When I come home, I fell asleep without
fighting chaotic thoughts. From that day, I started practicing
reflection every evening, and it now it is one of the most beneficial
habits I have.

## Reflect on the Day

I start the practice by going through the day. I analyze my actions,
habits, human interactions, feelings. During these evening sessions, I
can find which series of events made me skip good habits and pick a bad
one. I can see if I was doing my best or not, and what was a possible
reason for that. The practice helps me keep the mind clear during the
day because I don't need to worry about things knowing that I will take
my time to think in the evening. This practice also has a positive
impact on productivity, when your mind spends less time thinking about
life problems, you can stay in focus longer.

## Reflect on Areas of Life

Next, I think about life projects. These are the main areas in life that
matter. I separate each project from another and reflect on it. Am I
putting enough work into it? Am I doing the right things? Am I giving
too much time and energy to the project, and is it better to reallocate
resources into another one? After asking these questions, I could better
see what actions I should take.

## Set intention for the next day

The last part is to plan the next day. You could be lost tomorrow
without a planÂ . For example, if you don't know if you will run or go to
the gym, it will make it more possible for you to turn off the alarm and
don't have a morning routine at all. Also, not having a plan of action
for tomorrow will make you less productive since you will waste more
time and energy second doubting.

## Find Time for Reflection Practice

These days it is hard to find yourself in a state of boredom that leads
to thinking about life. Therefore it is more reliable to allocate time
for reflection during the day.

When you don't have time to think it is easier to get lost in life, your
mind may become fixed on things that you do most of the time, and you
may not see all the possibilities around you. You may continue having
bad habits without an understanding of what causing them and have the
same errors without learning lessons from them.

Reflection practice doesn't take much time, and it can bring positive
changes to your life, consider giving it a try.
